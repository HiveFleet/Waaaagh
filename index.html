<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
  Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
<p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
  Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
<p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
  Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
<p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
  And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
  Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
<p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
  Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
<p>And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>
  Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
  Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
